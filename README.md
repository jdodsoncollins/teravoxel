CSS Bootstrap template WordPress theme


Installation:

1. Download zip, unzip it

2. Copy folder to >wp-content/themes


This theme is designed to be easy to modify, and quick to load. It does not have a fancy admin interface for items like swapping out graphics via a GUI, so some familiarity with html/css is assumed.
